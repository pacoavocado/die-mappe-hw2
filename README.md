## So much struggle just to get a box to line up 

Turns out I didn't have the </html> at the end and nothing worked (well) till about an hour before due.

Got to lvl 14 in flexboxfroggy tho so we've got that going for us.  Well time to commit and mess up the deployment....

SEE YOU ON THE FLIP SIDE

## Update: sunday

I have finally figured out how to ustilize flex I scrapped the entire css and cleaned up the html removing much of the excess elements that were unnecessary and refined the class's and id's.  This project was a nightmare for me 1 week ago now I enjoy working on it for an extra hour to make it look better and to understand the style options in css.
