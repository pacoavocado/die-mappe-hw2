## **First Assignment**


## HTML OPTIMIZATION

The original index.html was full of div's that were not optimized for modern HTML5.  First all div's were replaced with section, with exception to the header which contains the link bar.  The header div's were replaced with nav before and after the unordered list elements.  The list elements link to the body information sections lower on the page. Then an alt image ?placeholder? was added for all the missing images.  Last the header and footer were both optimized for the style.css.  

## CSS REFINEMENT

The header and footer both had class definitions that were reomoved from the index so the (.) was removed from the respective element id's. The div tags in the header were also changed to nav to define the unordered list elements. 

> **Note**: The title within the head of the index was changed from "website" to "Horiseon Online Services" just for fun!!!
